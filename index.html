                    <div class="panel ico-backend">
                        <h4>Backend Software Development</h4>
                        <p>I set the foundation for long-term stability, performance, and predictability. Using the
                            latest tools and methodologies, I continuously produce high-quality code that is easy to
                            maintain and scale. In a nutshell: I'm your backend now.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel ico-frontend">
                        <h4>Frontend Software Development</h4>
                        <p>Frontend development is not just fun and games. It's hell, knives, forks, spoons, and serving
                            plates all in one kitchen! Allow me to worry about all the complexities of your project. I
                            will provide you with the most beautiful experience possible for your customers.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel ico-devops">
                        <h4>Devops</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes you just want to Netflix and chill, but other times you want to deliver software at
                            high velocity to mercilessly beat down your competition. Yeah, I'm the guy that sets up your
                            infrastructure and deployment processes for fun... and um, well, profit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel ico-architecture">
                        <h4>System Architecture</h4>
                        <p>Software doesn't exist in a vacuum. It needs a database, firewalls, electro-conspicutators,
                            and many other components that form the bigger picture. You need someone that knows what the
                            heck they're talking about here.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel ico-api">
                        <h4>API Development</h4>
                        <p>It sounds technical, and it is. Your customers (might) love you more if you give them a way
                            to interact with your software with their software. Whether it's REST, GraphQL, or SOAP,
                            look no further, I'm the API whisperer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel ico-flutter">
                        <h4>Flutter Mobile Development</h4>
                        <p>If it's the selfie generation that you are targeting, you'd better have a mobile application
                            in place that delivers that instant Dopamine hit. I use Flutter to cost-effectively build
                            fast mobile apps for Android and iOS.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve been responsible for all the planning, design, infrastructure, and software
                            development behind the IndieMaker platform. Initially, we had a simple Laravel PHP
                            application that I eventually rebuilt in Ruby on Rails. Our next release is around the
                            corner, and it will take the platform to the next level. We&rsquo;re currently growing with
                            around 1000 new makers a month.</p>

                            their employees as an extended benefit. We&rsquo;ve recently opened it to the public, and
                            the app can be downloaded and used if you are in a supported region. We aggressively work to
                            bring users the best in class Perks in the form of discounts and deals.</p>

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <div class=flexed>
                    <div class=copy>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve been building software for the web, desktop, hardware, and mobile platforms for
                            the better part of 17 years, and millions of people worldwide use my work. My experience
                            includes all the usual tools and tricks you&rsquo;d expect from a senior-level software
                            developer and solutions architect.</p>
                        <p>Problem-solving in the simplest possible way is at the heart of my work. I have a pragmatic,
                            no-nonsense approach that focuses on simplicity and results. I choose to spend my time based
                            on this core philosophy that software should make people and businesses better at what they
                            do. Creating systems in this way is what inspires me to keep creating.</p>
                        <p>My background includes founding and running a custom software development studio for a
                            decade. As an owner of a software studio, I acquired many hats, really - I have a cupboard
                            full. I hired, scaled, and worked with remote development teams for the studio and clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>Projects at the studio were often high-stake, complex, multi-stakeholder projects. As a
                            result, I&rsquo;m used to working with and managing various people - from freelancers,
                            contractors, digital agencies, large enterprises, third-party software providers to a host
                            of service providers.</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s been an action-packed journey, so I&rsquo;ve done all the hacking, big stakes,
                            high-pressure, late-night glamour you saw on the Silicon Valley series. And what&rsquo;s
                            more, I lived to write this!</p>
